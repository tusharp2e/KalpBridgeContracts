## Introduction ##

This repo contains contracts and postman collection. Contract of UserNFTs, KalpNFTs and KalpBridge which are being deployed on Avalanche, Binance and Polygon available. 

KalpResettableNFTs and UserResettableNFTs are the resettable contracts which are designed for the testing purpose. They are designed so that all minted tokenIds can be burned. With this feature, we wont need to deploy UserNFTs and KalpNFTs again from scratch on every deployment of Bridge Contract.
